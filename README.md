GPIO-Server
===========

This is a simple python web server that basically controls one GPIO port (and maybe more later) on my UDOO board.

My first goal is to remotely control the lighting of the entrance to my basement tinkering lab. Actually I've already reached that goal but there is still some polishing to do.

Later on I'd like a server like this to be part of a geocache I'm going to install involving visible or audible morse codes or something. :)
