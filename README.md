GPIO-Server
===========

This is a simple python web server that basically controls one GPIO port (and maybe more later) on my UDOO board.

My first goal is to remotely control the lighting of the entrance to my basement tinkering lab.

Later on I'd like a server like this to be part of a geocache I'm going to install.
